## Enhancements:
I updated this project by enhancing its usability, accessibility, and overall presentation. Semantic HTML improvements were implemented to improve structure and readability, while color contrast adjustments ensure better accessibility. Open Graph meta tags were added for improved social media sharing. A theme switcher was introduced for light and dark themes, but it was later removed on mobile screens for a cleaner UI. Additionally, profile section responsiveness was refined for better display on iPads and mobile devices. Smooth transitions and fade-in animations were also added to project cards, making the interface more dynamic and engaging.
